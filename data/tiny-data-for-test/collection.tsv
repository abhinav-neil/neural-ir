2776222	Best Answer: Allele, probably. In humans and other sexually reproducing diploid organisms, there are two copies of every gene - one is inherited from the mother and the other is inherited from the father. The two copies are often referred to as alleles. If the two alleles for a given gene are the same the organism is said to be homozygous for that gene; if they are different the organism is said to be heterozygous for that gene. The other way the term allele is used is as an alternate form of a gene.

The chemical formula for sodium chloride is NaCl, which means that for every sodium atom present, there is exactly one chloride atom. Sodium chloride has a molar mass of 58.44 grams per mole.
5353896	You can get the mass of all the elements in amu from the periodic table. For example, sodium chloride has one sodium atom with a mass of 22.9898 amu and one chlorine atom with a mass of 35.453 amu for a total of 58.4428 amu. So, one mole of sodium chloride is 58.4428 grams. If I have 29.2214 grams of sodium chloride, then I have half of a mole. One kilogram of sodium chloride is 1000 g / 58.4428 g = 17.1107 moles. (2) Convert moles to the number of molecules. This is easy, which is why the mole unit is so useful. The number of molecules in one mole is Avogadro's number: . (3) Count the number of constituents in each molecule. Each molecule of sodium chloride has one sodium atom and one chlorine atom. So, from the previous step, 10 grams of sodium chloride has sodium atoms and the same number of chlorine atoms.

Most marine life needs calcium carbonate to make shells and bones.Since sodium carbonate isn't so vital I suppose it qualifies as more harmful.Don't confuse it with the rather harmless sodium hydrogen carbonate or sodium bicarbonate.) I think using washing soda (sodium carbonate) in the house is not a big environmental issue because it is harmless when dissolved. Neutralization of sodium carbonate with hydrochloric acid will produce sodium chloride.
